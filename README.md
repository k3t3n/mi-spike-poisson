# Mutual Information for a Poisson Mixture Model of Spiking Neurons

This repo contains example code for modeling multi-unit neuronal responses as a Poisson mixture and calculating the mutual information as described in the following
paper:

**Quantifying Neuronal Information Flow in Response to Frequency and Intensity Changes in the Auditory Cortex**, by
Ketan Mehta, Joerg Kliewer, and Antje Ihlefeld.

- The folder 'MI' contains code for calculating the mutual information of a general Poisson Mixture of two random variables with specified weights.
